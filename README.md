title: Don't let He see you.

Game developed in Python using Pyxel library for a college assignment. 
All images and scripts were made entirely by me.
If you are an english speaker, try the EN version of the game. Soon I will be translating the code and make an EN version of it too.
The game has a simple objective, you have to escape this place and to do so you must find ways to get more powerfull while hiding from Him.

Controlls:
  Standard:
    Enter - Press to start playing and to respawn if He has found you.
    Q or Esc - Press to close the game.
    A - Hold to go left.
    D - Hold to go right.
    W - Hold to go up in a staircase.
    Shift - Hold to run. -be carefull, He listens if you get too close-

  Powers (you need to unlock those):
    Ctrl - Hold to get tiny.
    E - Press to get invisible for 5 seconds, then wait 6.5 seconds to do it again.
