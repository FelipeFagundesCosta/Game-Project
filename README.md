# Game-project: Don't let he see you.

# About

Game developed in Python using Pyxel library for a college assignment. 

All images and scripts were made entirely by me.

If you are an english speaker, try the EN version of the game. Soon I will be translating the code and make an EN version of it too.

The game has a simple objective, you have to escape this place and to do so you must find ways to get more powerfull while hiding from the enemy.


# Controlls:

  Standard:
    
  Enter - Press to start playing and to respawn if the enemy has found you.
    
  Q or Esc - Press to close the game.
    
  A - Hold to go left.
    
  D - Hold to go right.
    
  W - Hold to go up in a staircase.
    
  Shift - Hold to run. -be carefull, the enemy listens if you get too close-
    

  Powers (you need to unlock those):
  
  Ctrl - Hold to get tiny.
    
  E - Press to get invisible for 5 seconds, then wait 6.5 seconds to do it again.
