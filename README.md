# Game-project: Don't let he see you.

# About

Game developed in Python using Pyxel library for a college assignment. 

All images and scripts were made entirely by me.

The game has a simple objective, you have to escape this place and to do so you must find ways to get more powerfull while hiding from the enemy.


# Playing and editing:

If you just want to play the game, you can do so by clicking [here](https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/launcher/?run=FelipeFagundesCosta.Game-Project.Source.Don't_let_he_see_you), or you can download one of the files that are out of any folder. I recommend you to download the .exe to run the game in you own machine. 

Otherwise, if you would like to run it using the Pyxel library, run the following command in the terminal in the same folder where the file "Don't_let_he_see_you.pyxapp":

    pyxel run Don't_let_he_see_you.pyxapp

To edit the game, you can find the source code in the Source folder, there is the Python file and also the assets of the game in the file ASSETS.pyxres.

To access and edit the assets file, run the following command in your terminal in the same folder where the the file ASSETS.pyxres is:

    pyxel edit ASSETS.pyxres
